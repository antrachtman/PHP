/*
CRYPT_BLOWFISH - Blowfish hashing with a salt as follows: "$2a$",
 "$2x$" or "$2y$", a two digit cost parameter, "$", and 22 characters
 from the alphabet "./0-9A-Za-z". Using characters outside of this range
 in the salt will cause crypt() to return a zero-length string.
 The two digit cost parameter is the base-2 logarithm of the iteration count for the 
underlying Blowfish-based hashing algorithmeter and must be in range 04-31,
 values outside this range will cause crypt() to fail. Versions of PHP before 5.3.7
 only support "$2a$" as the salt prefix: PHP 5.3.7 introduced the new prefixes to
 fix a security weakness in the Blowfish implementation. To summarise, developers 
targeting only PHP 5.3.7 and later should use "$2y$" in preference to "$2a$".
